# Dominoes Game (Java and Prolog programming Languages)
I created a windows instance on AWS with a key pair to connect to my instance using a remote desktop client. Inside of this instance, I installed swi-prolog (version 9.3.7-1.x64 ), Netbeans 15 and JDK8 (All the installables are in this repository). Then, I configured environment variables for swi-prolog. 

Below, I add some sceenshots to show all the steps previously commented.

* Windows Version

JPL.jar libary used is the one which is coming with the swi-prolog installation. We can find it inside of DominoProlog/dist/lib/.

On the other hand, in Testing folder we can see a video and screenshots with the results of running the application.
